Indoor Microbiome Analysis â€“ Human Disturbance Effects
Overview
Humans spend ~90% of their time indoors, making it crucial to understand how built environments influence microbiomes. This project analyzes the microbial state of an unoccupied house and investigates whether minimal human disturbance affects yeast and mold populations.

Purpose
To determine whether standardized swabbing procedures and light human activity influence microbial growth in a controlled indoor environment.

Methodology
Location: Unoccupied residential house

Sampling:

Swabs taken from consistent indoor surfaces over 3 days

Samples stored in PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)

Analysis:

Cultured on Petri films to assess yeast and mold growth

Quantified and statistically analyzed using R

Key Findings
No statistically significant difference in microbiome due to brief human presence.

Swabbing method proves reliable for built environment sampling.

Reinforces the need for standardized protocols in microbiome research.
