# Indoor Microbiome Analysis – Human Disturbance Effects

## 🧬 Overview

Humans spend approximately 90% of their time indoors, making it essential to understand how built environments affect microbial communities.  
This project analyzes the microbiome of an unoccupied house and investigates whether minimal human disturbance influences yeast and mold populations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To determine if standardized swabbing procedures and minimal human activity impact microbial growth in a controlled indoor environment.

---

## 🔬 Methodology

- **Location**: Unoccupied residential house  
- **Sampling Procedure**:
  - Swabs collected from consistent surface locations over 3 consecutive days
  - Samples placed into PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) solution
- **Analysis**:
  - Cultured on Petri films to assess yeast and mold presence
  - Data analyzed statistically using **R**

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- No statistically significant effect from brief human presence
- Swabbing method is reliable and consistent
- Highlights the importance of standardized microbiome sampling protocols

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Standardized swabbing protocol (Noble Lab & REU students)
- Petri film microbial growth analysis
- R programming language for statistical analysis
